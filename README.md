This is a solution to the [Pomodoro app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pomodoro-app-KBFnycJ6G). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

  - Mobile-first, for viewports **< 600px**
  - Tablet(Portrait and Landscape), for viewports from **600px** to **1200px**
  - Desktop for viewports **< 1200px**
- Set a pomodoro timer and short & long break timers
- Customize how long each timer runs for
- See a circular progress bar that updates every minute and represents how far through their timer they are
- Customize the appearance of the app with the ability to set preferences for colors and fonts
